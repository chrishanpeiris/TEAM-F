Title

The loan code can support three different types of currency, but inside the code has a lot of duplicated codes, so we are using chain constructors method to refactoring it.

Motivation

Writing duplicate code in two or more constructors in the same category is the seed that is burying trouble for yourself.

Pattern

We often use the Constructor Chaining style for refactoring: the specific constructor function calls the general-purpose constructor, repeating the process until the most general constructor is called.
If the end of each call chain is the same constructor, I call it the "catch-all" constructor because it handles calls to all constructors.
