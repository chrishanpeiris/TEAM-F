Title - Factory Pattern (creational design pattern)

Motivation to refactor - The motivation of this pattern is to create a separate interface to create an object and initiate the classes based on subclass selection. In this example, the type of Dog selected based on the requirements.
 
Pattern/refactoring method - By using the Factory pattern, we can create a separate interface to call upon requirements
