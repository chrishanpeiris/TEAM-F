Title - Facade Pattern (structural design patterns)

Motivation to refactor - Using this pattern we can reduce the complexity of a system by structuring the system into subsystems, in this example, to start a car, there are many things happening behind the scene, if those things call when starting the system, it will quite complex, but we can put them into sub-systems and reduce the complexity. 

Pattern/refactoring method - By using the Facade pattern, we can create system into subsystems
