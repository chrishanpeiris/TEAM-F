Created an abstract class called GameTemplate to define all the common methods. This is because abstract methods inside abstract class can override in sub class as we needed. Created a constant template method inside GameTemplate abstract class and define the order of all the methods to be executed. Created an object of GameTemplate class inside the main method and assign new instances of Cricket and Football classes and run the template by calling subclasses, then methods will be override based on the subclass changes and run the output we wanted based on the game.
