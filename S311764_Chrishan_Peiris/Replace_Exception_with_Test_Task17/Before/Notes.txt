Title - Replace exception with a test. Simplifying Method Calls.

Motivation to refactor - Exception handling should only be used to handle irregular behaviours of a code. If it is possible to avoid exception handling in simple situations, we must replace it with a simple condition rather than throwing exceptions.    

Pattern/refactoring method - By using replace exception with a test method, we can avoid throwing exceptions in simple situations.
